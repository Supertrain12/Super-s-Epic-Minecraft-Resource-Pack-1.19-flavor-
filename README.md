# Super-s-Epic-Minecraft-Resource-Pack-1.19-flavor-
Hello. If you're reading this, you actually care to read the readme files. Well, I guess you read them if you don't know what to do.

Either way, this is how you put this file in the right place.
1. Locate the .minecraft file. If you are on Windows, you can easily do this by pressing Windows Key + R and typing in "%appdata%"
2. Navigate to .minecraft > resourcepacks. This folder (resoucepacks) is where you put the file.
3. Place the thingy into the folder. Make sure to unzip!
4. Enjoy.














...Ok, if you want to save yourself from my unfunny suprise, simply navigate to Super's Epic Resource Pack 1.19 Flavor > Assets > minecraft > textures > misc. Rename "spyglass_scope.png" to "amogus.png" and "fartspyglass_scope.png" to "spyglass_scope.png".
